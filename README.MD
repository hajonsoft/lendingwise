# Overview

This project converts a lendingwise loan to mismo format. 

# Getting Started

Node is used to read an input JSON object then write an output mismo file. The input JSON is called loan.json located at ./assets folder. The output is called mismo_loan.xml saved to ./output folder.

## Design

xmlbuilder2 npm package is used to easily create the xml. This is easier than php which I am not so experienced with. Ultimately the logic must be converted to php before delivery to lendingwise.
